## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: 1.25 or later (see `go.mod` for the exact version).
- **Git**: For cloning and submodules.
- **C compiler**: Required for CGO (e.g. `gcc`, `musl-dev` on Alpine).
- **Node.js** (optional): Only if you plan to work on or rebuild the frontend. The repo can be run with pre-built frontend assets.

### Clone and Submodules

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wtfdelphia/wtf-s-ui
cd s-ui
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The **frontend** lives in a submodule. If you only work on the backend, you can use the existing `web/html` contents or build the frontend once (see below).

### Backend-Only Development (quickest)

1. Build and run with the provided script (builds backend and runs with debug + local DB):

   ```bash
   ./runSUI.sh
   ```

   This runs `./build.sh` then `SUI_DB_FOLDER="db" SUI_DEBUG=true ./sui`.

2. Or build manually:

   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   SUI_DB_FOLDER=db SUI_DEBUG=true ./sui
   ```

   Default panel: **http://localhost:2095/app/** (user: `admin`, password: `admin` — change in production).

### Full Stack (Backend + Frontend)

1. **Frontend** (separate repo in submodule):

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Replace web assets and build backend**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p web/html
   rm -rf web/html/*
   cp -R frontend/dist/* web/html/
   . ./build-tags.sh
   go build -ldflags "$(ldflags_for dev)" -tags "$(tags_for dev)" -o sui main.go
   ```

3. Run:

   ```bash
   SUI_DB_FOLDER=db SUI_DEBUG=true ./sui
   ```

### Build Tags

`build-tags.sh` is the single source of truth for the tags and the linker flags that go
with them. Ask for a profile by name rather than copying a list:

```bash
. ./build-tags.sh
TAGS=$(tags_for dev)
go build -tags "$TAGS" -ldflags "$(ldflags_for dev)" ...
```

Profiles: `test`, `dev`, `release`, `windows`, `docker`. Assign before use, so an unknown
name aborts under `set -e` instead of expanding to an empty string.

Use these when building or testing locally, otherwise you get the stub implementations for
OpenVPN, OpenConnect, Tailscale, Cloudflared and naive instead of the real ones. The file
documents the per-platform deltas (Windows and Docker swap `with_musl` for `with_purego`).

### Environment Variables (development)

| Variable       | Description                    | Example   |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-----------|
| `SUI_DB_FOLDER`| Directory for SQLite DB files  | `db`      |
| `SUI_DEBUG`    | Enable debug mode              | `true`    |
| `SUI_LOG_LEVEL`| Log level                      | `debug`   |
| `SUI_BIN_FOLDER` | Directory for binaries       | `bin`     |

### Docker (optional)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wtfdelphia/wtf-s-ui
cd s-ui
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker build -t s-ui .
# or: docker compose up -d
```

## Coding Conventions and Style Guide

### General

- Write clear, maintainable code. Prefer small, focused functions and packages.
- Comment non-obvious logic and public APIs.
- Handle errors explicitly; avoid ignoring `err` unless intentional.

### Go Style

- Follow **standard Go style** and **[Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)**.
- Run **gofmt** (or **goimports**) before committing:

  ```bash
  gofmt -w .
  # or: goimports -w .
  ```

- Use **camelCase** for unexported names and **PascalCase** for exported names.
- Keep package names short and lowercase (e.g. `api`, `service`, `util`).
- Group imports: standard library, then third-party, then project imports (as in existing files).

### Project Structure Conventions

- **`api/`**: HTTP handlers and API routing (e.g. `apiHandler.go`, `apiV2Handler.go`).
- **`service/`**: Business logic and panel/core operations.
- **`database/model/`**: GORM models and DB entities.
- **`util/`**: Shared utilities (e.g. link/sub conversion, JSON).
- **`core/`**: sing-box integration and core runtime.
- **`sub/`**: Subscription (link/json) handling.

When adding new features, place code in the appropriate layer (handler → service → model/util) and avoid circular dependencies.

### Naming and Patterns

- Handlers: suffix `Handler` (e.g. `APIHandler`, `APIv2Handler`).
- Services: suffix `Service` or use package name (e.g. `ApiService`, `LinkService`).
- Models: clear struct names with JSON/gorm tags (see `database/model/`).

## Testing

### Current State

- The repo has tests under `core/`, `database/`, `service/`, `sub/` and `util/`, using the
  standard library `testing` package. There is no assertion library -- `t.Fatal` for setup
  failures, `t.Errorf` for assertions.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs `gofmt`, `go vet`, the tests and the race detector on
  every pull request.

### Running the Tests

Tests must be run with the release build tags. Several protocols sit behind tags, and
without them sing-box swaps in the stubs from `core/register_*_stub.go` -- the compat
tests then skip rather than cover anything:

```bash
. ./build-tags.sh
TAGS=$(tags_for test)
go test -tags "$TAGS" ./...
go test -race -short -tags "$TAGS" ./api/... ./service/... ./sub/... ./database/... ./util/... ./logger/... ./network/...
```

Use `test`, not `dev`: `dev` adds the cronet tags, which need a toolchain only the release
workflow sets up. `test` is what the release builds for armv6, armv5 and s390x, so nothing
goes uncovered.

A check in `.github/workflows/test.yml` fails the build if a tag list is pasted inline
anywhere outside `build-tags.sh`.

### Writing Tests

- Table-driven subtests with `t.Run`, following the existing files.
- `t.TempDir()` for scratch space -- never `/tmp` or `os.MkdirTemp`.
- For a database, `database/migration_singbox114_test.go` has `openTestDB(t)` (raw schema,
  no migrations); `service` tests call `database.InitDB(...)` when they need the full
  migrated schema.
- In `core`, wrap a `NewBox` error with `skipIfFeatureMissing(t, err)` (`core/main_test.go`)
  so the test skips in a build without the tag instead of failing.
- Say *why* the case exists in a comment. Regression tests should name the bug they lock down.

### Manual Testing

Run with `./runSUI.sh` and exercise the changed area. Note the panel must keep working
over **both plain HTTP and HTTPS** -- check login, session persistence across a refresh,
and logout in both modes when touching anything in `api/session.go`, `web/` or `network/`.

### Running the Linter (optional)

```bash
go vet ./...
# Optional: staticcheck, golangci-lint, etc.
```

## Features That Need Help

Community help is especially valuable in these areas. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/wtfdelphia/wtf-s-ui/issues) for current tasks and ideas.

### High-Value Areas

- **Multi-inbound per user**: Core differentiator of S-UI; improvements to UX, docs, and robustness are welcome.
- **API (v1 and v2)**: Completeness, consistency, and documentation (see [API Documentation](https://github.com/alireza0/s-ui/wiki/API-Documentation)).
- **Subscription service**: Link conversion, JSON subscription, and info endpoints (`sub/`, `util/`).
- **Testing**: Adding unit and integration tests for critical paths.
- **Documentation**: User docs, API examples, and contribution docs (like this file).
- **Platform support**: macOS is experimental; Windows and Linux improvements are welcome (see `windows/` and `.github/workflows/`).

### How to Find Tasks

- **Good first issue**: Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
- **Feature requests**: [Feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).
- **Bugs**: [Bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

If you want to work on a larger feature, open an issue first to discuss approach and avoid duplicate work.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork and branch**

   - Fork the repository on GitHub.
   - Create a branch from `main`: e.g. `git checkout -b fix/issue-123` or `feature/sub-improvements`.

2. **Make your changes**

   - Follow the [Coding Conventions](#coding-conventions-and-style-guide).
   - Run `gofmt` and ensure the project builds (see [Testing](#testing)).
   - Keep commits focused and messages clear (e.g. "Fix link conversion for VMess", "Add tests for outJson").

3. **Push and open a PR**

   - Push your branch and open a Pull Request against `main`.
   - Use the PR description to explain:
     - What problem or feature the PR addresses.
     - What you changed and how to verify it.
   - Reference any related issue (e.g. "Fixes #123").

4. **Review and CI**

   - Maintainers will review your code. CI (e.g. build workflows) must pass.
   - Address feedback by pushing new commits to the same branch.

5. **Merge**

   - Once approved and CI is green, a maintainer will merge your PR. Thank you for contributing!

### PR Guidelines

- Prefer **small, reviewable PRs**. Split large features into logical steps.
- Avoid unrelated changes (e.g. formatting-only or refactors in a feature PR).
- Ensure your branch is up to date with `main` before submitting (rebase or merge as the project prefers).

## Adding This Guide in Your Repository

If you maintain a fork or your own repository and want the contribution guide to be visible and linked properly:

1. **Keep `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the repository root**  
   GitHub automatically discovers a file named `CONTRIBUTING.md` (or `CONTRIBUTING`) in the root. When someone opens a new issue or pull request, GitHub can show a link to it. The community profile also uses it for the “Contributing” section.

2. **Link from README**  
   Add a short line in your main `README.md` so new contributors see it when they land on the repo, for example:
   ```markdown
   **Want to contribute?** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup, coding conventions, and the pull request process.
   ```

3. **Optional: GitHub “Contributing” link**  
   In the repository **Settings → General → Features**, ensure “Issues” (and optionally “Discussions”) are enabled. The link to `CONTRIBUTING.md` appears when users create a new issue or PR; no extra config is needed as long as the file is in the root.

4. **When forking**  
   If you fork S-UI, `CONTRIBUTING.md` is already in the repo. Update the clone URLs and repo names in this file if you want your fork’s contribution instructions to point to your own repository.
